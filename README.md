Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing the Caffeine cache in a Spring Boot application. Caffeine is a high-performance, near-optimal caching library that improves application response times by storing frequently accessed data in memory. The Caffeine Cache in Spring Boot project is designed to enhance the performance of an application that utilizes external API data. In this project, we integrate the third-party API - Fixer API - and effectively cache its responses to optimize response times.
